# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have a few different ideas currently. I think im leaning towards making a certain game

some kind of plagiarism checker.
 
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am working by myself.

I have no questions for now.
