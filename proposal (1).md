# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong Wars!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create a pong game where two-players face each other. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be quite similar to the popular game called "Pong". It is almost like an online table tennis game. I will be using the Pygame module inside of Python to create my software. This game will consist of two players using a character from the keyboard to control their side. To complete this, I will need to be able to make GUI's, import game logic, and learn how to continue the game using a variety of functions after a player makes a decision in game. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Working by myself.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, the best thing I will accomplish during this project is learning from my mistakes. As a beginner to coding, this will be quite a challenge and I expect to make mistakes along my journey. However, I will learn from these mistakes and make it a lesson to help improve my coding. I will learn a good amount of information on how to use Pygame. It is very interesting and I hope to keep using it to create other simple games for fun. I will also learn more information on how to make 2 player video games.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for me is adding themes to my pong game! For example, the user can select what theme they want for the background to be (Christmas theme, halloween theme, animal theme, etc). 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to add more players to the game such as a 2v2 instead of a 1v1. I also want to try to see if I can make the game public so that my friends and I can play it far away, instead of using the same computer to play against each other. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will first start with improving my coding of course. I am going to keep learning the basic concepts and tools that are primarily used in python. While doing this, I will need to spend a large amount of time towards learning how to use Pygame module. I need to umderstand how it works and how to use the functions in it to get what I need to create my project. For example, I need to learn how to implement and use functions that involve drawings, fonts, images, joysticks, sounds, coordinates, etc.
