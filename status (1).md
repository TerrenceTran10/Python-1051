#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have done a lot of research and watch videos on how to use Pygame. I have also learned how to create the colors and how to make the game run on a different window. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to implement the game logic and learn how to make the game react to the users input such as hitting the pong ball. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far my only issue is learning how to implement all of the pong game logic properly. I have made some mistakes but I am getting better at fixing them.
